She’s a spontaneous, all-around family girl who models, loves to work out, plays basketball, video games, and eats all day errday.  When this caffeine-based life form is not hardcore studying/procrastinating, you’ll find her on the phone with her best friend Vaishali, planning her extravagant wedding on pinterest that you’re all invited to, and thinking of 3 more names for her future children.  FASA is her baby and she will gung ho Mom it forever.</span>

Outside of FASA, he is also VP of Technology and Information in the Alternative Investment Club at the University of Michigan. Sometimes referred to as "Dimps" for given reasons, you'll think this New Jerseyan always has a smile on his face no matter what. When he's not attempting to hide these craters, he also enjoys playing volleyball, taking on any competition of any sort, eating anything and everything, and watching the beautiful sunrise.</span>

Her goal for the next school year is to win an intramural sports championship, so if you play soccer or any other not lame sport, hit her up!</span>

Despite encompassing the spirit animal of the notorious Grumpy Cat, she has a soft spot for Pixar movies, beluga whales, food of all kinds and perhaps more importantly, this great organization that goes by FASA. As an Economics nerd and Treasurer of FASA, she is excited to weigh in on the "marginal costs" and "marginal benefits" of all the fun activities and events in store for this year.

In fact, 100% Indian. In her free time, she enjoys watching Suits, dancing, eating noms, and shopping.</span>

An international student from the Philippines, she aspires to share all her knowledge of Philippine culture with the rest of FASA. When she’s not studying into the late hours of the night with a venti-sized coffee in hand, you can find her taking countless buzzfeed quizzes, getting some well-deserved sleep, or daydreaming about the warm weather back home. When she has time to relax and unwind, you’ll find her either playing ping pong, watching or reading Game of Thrones, or cooking Filipino Food.</span>

If you need help, whether it's getting your files backed up (wonder what this is referring to lol) or you just need a friend to talk to, this is your guy. Nick dreams of having a cyan-colored German Shepherd dog named after one of the characters from Game of Thrones!!! THIS SHOULD BE MASS EFFECT SO WRONG!!!! while working full time at either Google, Microsoft, or Apple (even though he hates Apple, or excuse me, iPhones.) Nick is a music prodigy and can even sing and play "Wonderwall" by Oasis (watch out ladies ;)). Basically, Nick is good at everything and everyone wishes they were Nick. </span>
