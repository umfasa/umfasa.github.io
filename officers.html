						Josephine is a Pre-Pharmacy junior pursuing a major in Microbiology. Aside from her commitment to FASA, she works part-time as a Pharmacy Tech for UMHS. She's a spontaneous, all-around family girl who models, loves to work out, plays basketball, video games, and eats all day errday. When this caffeine-based life form is not hardcore studying/procrastinating, you'll find her on the phone with her best friend Vaishali, planning her extravagant wedding on pinterest that you're all invited to, and thinking of 3 more names for her future children. FASA is her baby and she will gung ho Mom it forever.

When he's not attempting to hide these craters, he also enjoys playing volleyball, taking on any competition of any sort, eating anything and everything, and watching the beautiful sunrise.

As an Economics nerd and Treasurer of FASA, she is excited to weigh in on the "marginal costs" and "marginal benefits" of all the fun activities and events in store for this year.
