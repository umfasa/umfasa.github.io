						Josephine is a Pre-Pharmacy junior pursuing a major in Microbiology. Aside from her commitment to FASA, she works part-time as a Pharmacy Tech for UMHS. She's a spontaneous, all-around family girl who models, loves to work out, plays basketball, video games, and eats all day errday. When this caffeine-based life form is not hardcore studying/procrastinating, you'll find her on the phone with her best friend Vaishali, planning her extravagant wedding on pinterest that you're all invited to, and thinking of 3 more names for her future children. FASA is her baby and she will gung ho Mom it forever.

						Kevin Silang is a junior majoring in Computer Science through the College of Engineering. Outside of FASA, he is also VP of Technology and Information in the Alternative Investment Club at the University of Michigan. Sometimes referred to as "Dimps" for given reasons, you'll think this New Jerseyan always has a smile on his face no matter what. When he's not attempting to hide these craters, he also enjoys playing volleyball, taking on any competition of any sort, eating anything and everything, and watching the beautiful sunrise.

						Delaney Ryan is a junior double-majoring in International Studies and Communications. Outside of FASA, she participates in K-Grams and the Michigan Association of Communications Studies and volunteers at the Boys’ and Girls’ Club. She loves traveling, swimming, her dog, weird music (I guess?), anything colorful, and pretending she knows more about filipino culture than she actually does (holla atcho halfie gurl). Her goal for the next school year is to win an intramural sports championship, so if you play soccer or any other not lame sport, hit her up!

						Soumi Santra is a sophomore deciding between a major in Biophysics or Neuroscience. Apart from being a pre-medical student, she also enjoys watching countless hours of beauty videos on youtube. Her main goal in life is to give back to the community in a meaningful way and to get a dog, preferably a husky. Or a corgi. Or a Corgski. Although she’s on board for FASA, she’s not Filipino at all. In fact, 100% Indian. In her free time, she enjoys watching Suits, dancing, baking and eating noms, and shopping.

						John Gonzalez is a sophomore majoring in Cellular and Molecular Biology on the Pre-med track hoping to be a pediatrician. John loves playing League of Legends and binge watching tv shows. His favorites right now are: Sherlock, Orange is the New Black, The Walking Dead, and Pretty Little Liars. Yes, he watches it to support our fellow Filipino, Shay Mitchell. He loves dogs but doesn’t have one of his own. He wants to have a corgi one day. He was in Time Magazine when he was only a freshman in high school. Expect him to be on the front cover of it when he develops the cure for cancer.

						Kristy Villarosa is a junior studying Economics and Applied Statistics. Though her typical resting face may result in bad first impressions, fear not! Despite encompassing the spirit animal of the notorious Grumpy Cat, she has a soft spot for Pixar movies, beluga whales, food of all kinds and perhaps more importantly, this great organization that goes by FASA. As an Economics nerd and Treasurer of FASA, she is excited to weigh in on the "marginal costs" and "marginal benefits" of all the fun activities and events in store for this year.

						Jon Gamiao is a junior working towards a major in Biomolecular Science. He ultimately aspires to go to medical school and become a physician just like his parents. An avid lover of music, Jon has been slaying with the keys since he was three, started shredding with the guitar at the age of twelve, and has gone to numerous concerts and festivals in the Metro-Detroit area. He has a passion for fine dining and tank tops. Tank season is his favorite season of the year. But unfortunately, it is the shortest season of the year.

						Trini Roxas is an incoming sophomore still deciding what to major in, but is definitely on the Pre-Dentistry track. An international student from the Philippines, she aspires to share all her knowledge of Philippine culture with the rest of FASA. When she’s not studying into the late hours of the night with a venti-sized coffee in hand, you can find her taking countless buzzfeed quizzes, getting some well-deserved sleep, or daydreaming about the warm weather back home. When she has time to relax and unwind, you’ll find her either playing ping pong, watching or reading Game of Thrones, or cooking Filipino Food.

Other activities Kathleen likes to busy herself with include Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan, enjoying Disney movie marathons, hosting spontaneous dance parties anytime and anywhere on campus, squandering hours on Pinterest, online window shopping, and indulging in her unconditional love for peanut butter.
